    <p>Hey! I'm Reese and I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley. I'm choosing between Computer Science and ORMS for my major,
       and I'm also applying to Haas. In any case, I really like programming, and am looking forward to learning
       web development in this class and helping out a nonprofit organization.</p>

    <p>Outside of school, I really like riding my bike and race for the Cal Cycling team. I also like to read, at least
       whenever I have the time, and I love to travel. So far I've been to 41 out of the 50 states, and I'm looking
       forward to the day when I can say I've been to them all.</p>

    <p>Some of my favorite things to do include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://cycling.berkeley.edu/">Cycling</a></li>
        <li>Traveling</li>
        <li>Drumming</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/">Reading</a></li>
        <li>Hiking</li>
