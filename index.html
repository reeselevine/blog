    <p>Hey! I'm Reese and I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley. I'm choosing between Computer Science and ORMS for my major,
       and I'm also applying to Haas. In any case, I really like
       programming, and look forward to working in the tech industry
       when I graduate.</p>

    <p>Outside of class, my passion is cycling, and if I don't answer
       my phone it's probably because I'm out riding my bike. During the
       school year I race for <a href="http://cycling.berkeley.edu">Cal Cycling</a>, and
       year round for <a href="http://teammikesbikes.com">Team Mike's Bikes p/b Equator
       Coffees</a>. I also like to read
       (currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged">Atlas
       Shrugged</a> by Ayn Rand), and I love to travel. So far I've
       been to 41 states, 9 countries besides the United States, and 4 continents, and I'm looking
       forward to the day when I can say I've been to them all.</p>
