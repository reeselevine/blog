How many inspirational stories have I read in my lifetime? Maybe it’s too much of a cliche to even point it out, but social media and the always on media culture we have become used to might be exacerbating the issue. It seems like every other post is about someone who beat the odds or overcame some problem in their past. Perhaps it’s true though. Maybe no one one makes it through this life unscathed; after all, we all die in the end. 

I’m sorry for being a little morbid. It’s just that these aren’t the best times. In the last week, a climber I never knew died in Colorado and a professional cyclist younger than me suffered a horrible crash in a race in Poland. And it’s not just me. More than one hundred thousand Americans are dead because of a virus that many still don’t seem to take seriously and millions are outraged over the needless deaths of Black Americans at the hands of overfunded, militarized police departments.

Oh yeah--I’m cancer free. I don’t like to say I “beat” cancer, since all I did was sit in a chair once every couple weeks and feel shitty for a week afterward. Chemotherapy is an awful awful process and it is incredible that hundreds of thousands of people manage to go through it every year. I mentioned two dates in my last blog: October 8, the day I was diagnosed, and April 6, the day of my last chemo. Add to that another, which conveniently also happens to be my birthday; May 4, the day I was officially told the cancer was gone.

So what is this, another inspirational story? I don’t know, I write for myself. I guess I can say I’ve had two near-death experiences now:
- The day I crashed at Chico. I don’t know if this actually qualifies as near-death, but it sure felt like it as I lay on the side of the road with a partially collapsed lung struggling to breathe.
- Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Sure, it would have caused my death, but it also would have taken another year or two. And just because they cured it once doesn’t mean it can’t come back, so am I still technically near death? Hard to say, probably not worth dwelling over.

But at least I’m still here.

“I want to live and I want people the world over affected with illness, ridden with deadly diseases, to live, to survive, to thrive”, writes Mallory Smith in Salt in My Soul: An Unfinished Life. I read Salt in My Soul in spring 2019, months before I was diagnosed. Her story of living with cystic fibrosis is powerful, and the emotion and passion in it hit me hard. I could never have imagined I’d be living through my own deadly disease the same year. Unfortunately, while I made it, Mallory didn’t. She died of complications after a double lung transplant in November 2017. 

“Over the last few years, however, as I’ve watched too many friends go to the mountains only never to return, I’ve realized something painful. It’s not just the memorable summits and crux moves that are fleeting. Friends and climbing partners are fleeting, too.” This is Hayden Kennedy in his post “The Day We Sent Logical Progression.” Twelve days later, on October 8 2017, Hayden was dead, the outcome of an avalanche that killed his girlfriend and climbing partner, Inge Perkins.

I feel as though I am suspended between Mallory and Hayden and the words they left behind in their short, brilliant lives. Hayden warns that “there is no glory, no real answers, in sending and summits,” but at the same time talks about “how mountains strip us down to our true selves.” I feel an urgency to live as Mallory hoped to, to say fuck you to the same body that produced the cells that tried to kill me and carries me miles over winding paths to summits and vistas. But as a fledgling climber I am forced to consider Hayden’s cautions and the pain of loss I could feel one day. 

I’m no stranger to risk and pain at this point. I’ve been cycling since I was eleven years old, and I know plenty of people who haven’t come back from a ride or race. I also know, or at least I can acknowledge, that I am privileged to have access to modern medicine and the means to be able to afford to do the things I want to do. I have the love of my family and friends, I have an amazing girlfriend, and as of a few months ago, I have a puppy who enjoys biting my hands and sleeping on the bed.

We moved to Santa Cruz last month. I’ll be starting a PhD program in computer science at UC Santa Cruz in the fall, and I’ve been busy exploring the endless trails and roads on my bike. The Sierras aren’t that far away and I have goals and aspirations that will keep me busy for the foreseeable future. All that to say, I’m living life. In Salt in My Soul, Mallory writes “I feel like I’m going to fade away and be forgotten.” While it’s clear that is not true, I want to add my voice to the chorus. As long as I’m here, Mallory, I promise to thrive. I also promise to take Hayden’s advice, to leave time to “stop, pause, breathe, and reflect.”

So in some ways, that’s what’s next.
