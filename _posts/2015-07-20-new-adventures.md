At some point it was inevitable that I started a blog, considering how much I love to write. However, after realizing that I didn't really want to be a journalist when I first got to college, I haven't really had the opportunity to stretch my creative writing muscles, school essays notwithstanding. So, why now?

Well, about a year ago I got this domain for free through a student offering from Github, and I figured it was a good time to build my own website and also snap up the reeselevine.me address before some other sneaky person did it instead. I wanted to work on some front-end web development for fun, and creating a simple, static blogging site seemed like the perfect way to do that. Of course, I worked on the site for a couple weeks in September of 2014, but for almost a year afterwards, I barely looked at it. So again, why now?

As I write this, I'm sitting in LAX waiting to board a plane that will take me to Melbourne by way of Sidney, where I would have been by now except that United was hit by delays and I missed my connection last night. In Australia, I will be studying at the University of Melbourne for five months, which will be the longest amount of time I've ever been away from the Bay Area. A little intimidating, but a lot of cool, and I want to be able to document my experience for my parents, friends, and for myself in a few years.

I don't want this blog to be entirely a travel blog, although the first few months it necessarily will be, but I also don't want it to be a tech blog, although the framework it is built on is meant for it (`see, I can even write in formatted code!`). I also really don't want it to be a cycling blog, although that is my main passion and will show up in quite a few of my posts. What I really want is for this to be a blog about me, and what I think is important in my life, and if that happens to mostly be travel, code, and cycling, so be it! (I bet you can figure out what I prefer to do with my time)

This post was supposed to be all about my summer, and create a grand backdrop for my study abroad experience, but it looks like I already got carried away in my intro, and I don't want to make my first entry too long. Therefore, I'll just give a brief summary of the last couple months of my life, and leave the grand backdrop for my next post.

In mid-May, I finished my second year at UC Berkeley, culminating with a fifth-place medal in the collegiate national cycling championships team time trial as part of the Cal Cycling team, and the declaration of my major, computer science. Yeah, I'm pretty cool; you'll get used to it.

*Collegiate nationals took place in Asheville, North Carolina. The Blue Ridge mountains are old, but the views of them never will be.*

After nationals, I willed myself through finals and immediately started interning at Munchery, a food deliver startup in the city. This was my first programming internship, making it a huge learning experience, but I loved every minute of the job and the workplace culture. In fact, I scared myself at times with my ability to get so deep into the code that I had to force myself to stop working when I got home. I also contributed a little bit to an open-source plugin for Jenkins that we needed for one of our intern projects at work, which made me realize that I definitely want open-source development to be a part of my programming future.

Meanwhile, I kept training and racing with Mike's Bikes, and although I wish I could have ridden more over the summer, I still had some fun times, from training in Mammoth Lakes for a weekend with Nate, to racing and hanging out with all of my teammates at amateur nationals in Truckee. I'm also really bummed that Equator coffees is opening a location in Berkeley on re-developed Lower Sproul just in time for me to leave, but I also can't wait to go there for the first time when I get back this winter!

So I think that about sums it up, although I could go into way more detail about the fun experiences I had, like rescuing a kid who capsized his sailboat on Donner Lake with my teammate and national time trial champion, Max Korus, or playing (and winning) a Munchery employee trampoline dodgeball tournament in the Presidio on the same team as the CFO. Alright, I'm done, but seriously, I could go on all day.

It's 00:27 right now, California time, but it's only 17:27 in Melbourne, so I'm going to try to stay up for another couple hours so that I when I arrive I'm not too jetlagged, because it's going to be a busy day. I will try to update this blog fairly regularly, but life may get in the way. For now, though, thanks for reading, and I leave you with one last picture of San Francisco and the Bay Area.
