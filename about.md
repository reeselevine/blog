I was born in SoCal, raised in NorCal, went to college at UC Berkeley, spent three years in Seattle as a software developer at [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com), and am now a PhD student at UC Santa Cruz.

Starting when I was 12 years old, I raced bikes for Tieni Duro Junior Cycling, and after I aged out of that, for Cal Cycling and Team Mike's Bikes. I don't race anymore, but you'll still catch me out on the roads/trails more often than not. In general, I love being outside and active, and I'll happily go ride, run, hike, ski, or climb anytime.


What else? I'm a cancer survivor; I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma when I was 24, and I've been in remission since April of 2020.

Of course, I'm more than just what I've done/been through in my life. Like me, this site will evolve and change over time, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it leads as much as I'm sure you are.
