# what i'm

- **doing now**: studying abroad [@melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au) for 6 months

- **watching**: [@gilmoregirls](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238784/) (trust me it's good!)

- **reading**: @75shortmasterpieces, stories from world literature. It's good to take a break from novels now and then, and I've always felt that short stories can carry a lot more meaning than many longer works.
