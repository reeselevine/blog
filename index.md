## Who I Am ##

Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the internet. My name is Reese, which is based off the old Welsh name [Rhys](http://www.behindthename.com/name/rhys), and not the delicious peanut butter filled chocolate that you probably associate it with. I go to school at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I am currently searching for an internship for next summer in software engineering.  My programming career is still young, so I am still exploring what area of computer science I would like to specialize in, and in the future I would love to get involved in research.

Outside of class, my passion is cycling, and if I don't answer my phone it's probably because I'm out riding my bike. During the school year I race for [Cal Cycling](http://cycling.berkeley.edu), and year round for [Team Mike's Bikes p/b Equator Coffees](http://teammikesbikes.com).
