### 0000: Kygo - Firestone ft. Conrad Sewell

I remember an early summer evening in Melbourne, I rode my bike south along the ocean, and stopped on the top of a small hill where the city was illuminated by the rays of the setting sun. There I listened to this song, and thought about having someone who I could light up the world with. Three months later, I found you. I chose this song as the opening song because it has the promise of hope and joy in its melody and rhythm. Before you my heart was just a rock, but with you it’s a firestone.

### 0001: Lost Frequencies – Are You With Me

Riding the Bart train to work in the summer of 2015, I listened to this song to remind me that one day I would escape far away from the bustle of the city and the stress of life. Now, I ask you, Sarah, are you with me? Will you be my one and only, will you go with me wherever I go, will you live life to the fullest with me? I think I know the answer.

### 0010: ODESZA – Say My Name ft. Zyra

I want to dance with you. The message in this song is pure and innocent, about love and how it feels to look at someone and want that person completely. You are the center of my life; no one knows you better than I do. Whenever I feel off my rhythm, the strong beat of this song brings me back to a happy place, and I can imagine us on a beach, in the mountains, anywhere in nature, dancing together with no one else around.

### 0011: The Chainsmokers – Roses ft. ROZES

I love the intro to this song, the synthesizers leading to the strong bass beat and lyrics promising a life of love and light. The theme of this song is simple; we will have a good life if you promise not to let me go. Deep in my bones I can feel you, Sarah, and when the beat drops all I think of is you and how good you make me feel.

### 0100: Disclosure – You & Me ft. Eliza Doolittle (Flume Remix)

This song is a little different; the beat isn’t quite so upbeat, and there aren’t as many lyrics. However, what this song lacks in expansive themes of love it makes up for in its repeated message (“it’s going to be you and me”) and its dark, thumping beat. This is not a song about butterflies and rainbows, but a song about the darker, more animalistic nature of humans. I love you, and I respect you, but on a primal level I want to own you, to share my dark desires with you, to be raw and rough in a way I can’t be with anyone else.

### 0101: Klangkarussell – Sonnentanz ft. Will Heard

For 20+ years, I walked through the valleys of the wilderness by myself. I have now found out that I need you, and I just wanted to let you know that I love you. The sun doesn’t shine when I’m not around you, Sarah, and I will never be without you again. Your love is mine, and every time I visit you my worries and troubles melt away. Don’t ever let go of me, and I promise I will never let go of you.

### 0110: Thomas Jack – Rivers (ft. Nico & Vinz)

There is no denying that long distance is hard. But we have found that even though we are like two rivers split, like One-Eye Creek in Laytonville, the waters that feed both rivers are from the same source, and we will always come back together. I love the chorus of this song, and so I can think of no better way to explain this song than to quote it:
    “We can make it into something beautiful, we don’t have to try. We can make it into something wonderful, we’ll never say goodbye.”

### 0111: Axwell /\ Ingrosso – Sun Is Shining

I know you struggle sometimes, and I know I struggle sometimes. But this song is a reminder that we are both beautiful people, and that everything will always be okay. I promise to always remind you that you shine like the sun, not because I want to cheer you up, but because I truly believe it.

### 1000: Galantis – Runaway (U & I)

The rising crescendo of this song always takes me to a place far beyond wherever I am, to a place where earth, other people, and even my body disappear. I think it of it as a place that I cannot share with anyone, except for the one I love. I hope that I will always be able to take you with me, and I hope that when you listen to this song it takes you there as well.

### 1001: Broods – Heartlines

Why did I choose this song as the last one? Well, for one, it always gives me chills when I listen to it. It describes our love so perfectly, and the yearning, earnest voice of Broods makes me feel like laughing and crying simultaneously. There is a slightly nostalgic feel, like looking back on the trips we took together last summer, but also a forward looking hope, of a future filled with love together. Separated as we are by hundreds of miles, it is important that the lines connecting our hearts remain as strong as ever, and I know that they will.

### 1010
10 songs, 10 reasons. I’ve chosen one song each from some of my favorite artists. You know how much music means to me, so you know that these were not chosen lightly. Each one reminds me of a different aspect of our relationship, and together they form a statement of the strength of our connection. I hope that whenever you want or need a reminder of us, you can visit this page and be reminded that you are mine, and I am yours.
